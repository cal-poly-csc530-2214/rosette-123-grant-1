# My Work

1 hour in: I tried to get started but I'm having a really hard time understanding rosette and don't know how solve vs verify work. 

I'd like to just do #1 but probably will have to wait until monday to see what I can actually do

# Major Update 1

I think I got HW problem 1 completed. This is pretty cool bc I didn't know if I'd be able to do it.

Learning rosette is very interesting and I think a major barrier for me was just really figuring out the difference between `solve` and `verify`. 

I think the trouble in learning though is something with all tools as docs cannot be perfect and in a small community (i.e. rosette users) a google search hardly satisfies.

Problem 1 took me much longer than I'd like to log haha.

# How I did HW1

I took the approach of applying solve first as this will tell me if a formula is a contradiction as it will return unsatisfiable (not be able to be solved)

After we have categorized contradictions we can proceed to verify the formula and see if this returns unsatisfiable. Unsatisfiable in this setting means that no counterexample could be found and thus this formula would be a tautology but if there is a possible counterexample then this formula is indeed a contingency.

# Update 2

Few more hours in. Tried to go over the slides for the course and attempted homework problem 2. I am not very knowledgable of logic but I tried to folloow the slides and use online resources.

I added a pdf of my process and my final solution I came to. 
It was good to get more comfortable with CNF and what it is. I wrote some notes, that consisted of pretty much copying the slides, but slowly and surely I am understanding things more.

# Plan going forward

I am going to continue to go over course materials and attempt to do some of the graph coloring coding and see what happens in class on wednesday

# Update 3

Ok that didn't work, I can't get the graph code to run as I'm getting a permission error on trying to open a file through racket so that's no good. 
And I don't understand the first part at all.
Hopefully we can go over this on Wednesday, but the due date has been extended until Friday so that gives me some time.
